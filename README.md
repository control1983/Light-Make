Light Makeï¼šMake product prototype by natural light
    Light Make is a new manufacturing method, which is different from traditional manufacturing in three aspects:
      1. The source of energy is the direct absorption of natural light, similar to the way plants absorb natural light to grow into various shapes. 
      2. The material used is a light-sensitive liquid, which is mixed with various additives to achieve different colors, textures and hardness.
Similar to plants, they grow various tissues through synthetic organic matter, including hard trunks, soft branches and leaves, and colorful petals.
      3. Transmission of information: The carrier of shape and size information in the manufacturing process is to build a shelter to block part of the light to achieve the molding in the manufacturing process.
